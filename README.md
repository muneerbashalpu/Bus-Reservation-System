# Bus-Reservation-System
The Bus Reservation System is a basic console program that runs on the C/C++ platform and has no visuals.
The system uses bus information, which includes the bus number, seat number, and the passenger's name, to book a seat on the bus. 
Under the passenger's name, the specific bus seat number is booked. 
This C/C++ project will also give the user with tutorials and basic guidance for writing code.
The primary goal of this project is to create an application that will allow users to make bus reservations.
Instead of using file management to store bus information, this system uses a different method.
he C++ programming language was used to create this.
It's simple to use and comprehend.
Bus information, such as bus number and driver's name, may be uploaded by users.
Furthermore, since the reservation is made in the passenger's name, it is quite straightforward.
In addition, the system displays all information about the buses and their corresponding seats.
This system also displays the buses that may be reserved.
